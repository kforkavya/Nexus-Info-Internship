# ‚ùì What is a Markov Chain?

A Markov Chain is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another, within a finite or countable number of possible states. It is a random process that has the key property of Markov property, meaning that the future state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.

In simpler terms, imagine a Markov chain as a sequence of events, where what happens next depends only on the current situation, not on how you got there.

Understanding Probabilities in a Markov Chain

In a Markov Chain, probabilities are assigned to each transition from one state to another. These probabilities are usually represented in a transition matrix if the number of states is finite. The sum of probabilities from any given state to all possible next states is always 1.

Example:

Let's consider a very simple Markov Chain with three states: A, B, and C. Suppose we have the following transitions observed:

- From A to B, 2 times.
- From A to C, 3 times.
- From B to A, 1 time.
- From B to C, 4 times.
- From C to A, 3 times.
- From C to B, 2 times.

To calculate the probabilities, we look at each state and divide the number of times each transition occurs by the total number of transitions from that state.

1. Probabilities from A:
   - To B: 2 transitions from A to B / Total transitions from A (2 to B + 3 to C) = 2 / 5 = 0.4
   - To C: 3 transitions from A to C / Total transitions from A (2 to B + 3 to C) = 3 / 5 = 0.6

2. Probabilities from B:
   - To A: 1 transition from B to A / Total transitions from B (1 to A + 4 to C) = 1 / 5 = 0.2
   - To C: 4 transitions from B to C / Total transitions from B (1 to A + 4 to C) = 4 / 5 = 0.8

3. Probabilities from C:
   - To A: 3 transitions from C to A / Total transitions from C (3 to A + 2 to B) = 3 / 5 = 0.6
   - To B: 2 transitions from C to B / Total transitions from C (3 to A + 2 to B) = 2 / 5 = 0.4

These probabilities can then be arranged in a transition matrix, which summarizes the transition probabilities from each state to every other state. For our example, the transition matrix would look like this:

|   | A   | B   | C   |
|---|-----|-----|-----|
| A | 0   | 0.4 | 0.6 |
| B | 0.2 | 0   | 0.8 |
| C | 0.6 | 0.4 | 0   |

This matrix tells us, for example, that if we are currently in state A, there is a 40% chance that the next state will be B and a 60% chance it will be C. Similarly, the other probabilities can be interpreted from the matrix.

Markov chains are powerful tools in various fields, including statistics, economics, and computer science, due to their ability to model complex random processes in a relatively simple and understandable way.

# Chatbot Project

## Overview

This project is a Simple Chatbot implemented using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically NLTK, and Keras. The chatbot is designed to provide a basic conversational experience.

## Features

### Basic Functionality:
1. **Greeting Function:** The chatbot implements a simple greeting function.
2. **Answering Basic Questions:** The chatbot responds to at least five basic questions.
3. **Farewell Message:** A farewell message is included for a more natural conversation flow.

### Previous Context:
4. **Contextual Memory:** The chatbot is designed to remember and reference the context of previous interactions.

### User Interaction:
5. **Interactive Flow:** The chatbot engages the user by asking at least three questions.
6. **User Responses:** Users can provide responses, and the chatbot reacts accordingly.

### Error Handling:
7. **Basic Error Handling:** The chatbot includes basic error handling to address scenarios where it doesn't understand the user's input. It provides a friendly response in such cases.

## Technologies Used

- **NLTK:** Natural Language Toolkit for natural language processing.
- **Keras:** A high-level neural networks API for building and training deep learning models.
